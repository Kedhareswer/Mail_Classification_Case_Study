# Email Classification Case Study

## Project Statement
This project aims to analyze and classify emails as spam or legitimate using machine learning techniques. The goal is to build a robust classification system that can accurately identify spam emails while minimizing false positives.

## Approach
1. Data Collection: Gather a diverse dataset of emails labeled as spam or ham
2. Data Preprocessing: Clean and transform the email data for analysis
3. Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features from email content
4. Model Training: Implement and evaluate various machine learning models
5. Deployment: Create a web interface for users to test the classification system

## Technologies Used
- Frontend: Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Node.js (if applicable)
- Machine Learning: Python (if applicable)
- Database: (if applicable)
